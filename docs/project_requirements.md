# Project Requirements - Elastic What's New Generator

## Business Context

### Purpose
Automate creation of quarterly "What's New" presentations and hands-on Instruqt labs for Elastic's Search, Observability, Security domains (individually or unified) to support sales pipeline generation.

### Target Audience
- **Mixed business/technical stakeholders**
- **Sales pipeline prospects**
- **Practitioners** (developers, security analysts, DevOps engineers)

### Key Business Outcomes
- Demonstrate why prospects should choose/upgrade to Elastic
- Show clear ROI and cost savings
- Reduce time-to-value (TTV)
- Enable focus on business vs. infrastructure
- Showcase platform value through unified domain presentations

## Framework Structure

### Three Universal Themes
1. **Simplify** - "Do more with less"
2. **Optimize** - "Do it faster" 
3. **AI Innovation** - "Do it with AI"

### Presentation Flow
1. **Opening Hook** - Infrastructure challenge
2. **Innovation Overview** - "Three Game-Changing Innovations"
3. **Theme Deep Dives** (3 slides) - Simplify, Optimize, AI Innovation
4. **Cross-Platform Benefits** - How Search enhances Observability/Security
5. **Competitive Differentiation** - Platform vs. point solutions
6. **Business Case/ROI** - Quantified benefits
7. **Call to Action** - Next steps

## Feature Requirements

### Input Process
- **Feature name**
- **Bullet points** describing capabilities
- **Reference links** to documentation
- **Domain specification** (Search/Observability/Security/All)
- **Automatic classification** into themes using AI
- **Web scraping** for additional context

### Multi-Domain Support
**Individual Domains**: Create focused presentations for Search, Observability, or Security
**All Domains**: Unified presentation that:
- Takes features from all three domains
- Uses AI to organize features into the three innovation themes
- Creates cross-domain storytelling and value propositions
- Demonstrates platform synergies and unified value

### Feature Grouping Examples
**Search Domain:**
- Simplify: Cross-Cluster Search, AutoOps, Elastic Managed LLM
- Optimize: BBQ, ACORN, ELSER Token Pruning  
- AI Innovation: LOOKUP JOIN, Inference Service, Agent Builder

**All Domains Example:**
- Simplify: Cross-cluster (Search), AutoOps (Observability), Managed LLM (All)
- Optimize: BBQ (Search), APM performance (Observability), SIEM efficiency (Security)
- AI Innovation: Agent Builder (All), AI Assistant (Observability), ML Security (Security)

## Lab Requirements

### Storytelling Approach
1. **Start with practitioner perspective**
2. **Identify relatable domain challenge**
3. **Create sense of urgency**
4. **Demonstrate Elastic solution**
5. **Tie back to innovation themes**
6. **Show clear business value**

### Technical Requirements
- **Instruqt platform** compatibility
- **Kibana access** (Discover, Dev Tools, etc.)
- **Sample data generation** for realistic scenarios
- **Step-by-step markdown** instructions
- **Hands-on feature exploration**

### Lab Types
- **Single feature** deep dives
- **Multi-feature** combination labs
- **Cross-domain** scenarios (e.g., Search + Security threat hunting)
- **Progressive difficulty** levels
- **Domain-specific** scenarios
- **Platform demonstrations** showing Search + Observability + Security working together

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Feature Input Interface** - Web form or API
2. **Web Scraping Engine** - Documentation gathering
3. **Elasticsearch Storage** - Feature and content storage
4. **AI Classification Engine** - Theme categorization (single/multi-domain)
5. **Presentation Generator** - Slide content creation (domain-specific or unified)
6. **Lab Generator** - Instruqt workshop creation (single/cross-domain scenarios)
7. **Sample Data Generator** - Realistic datasets for all domains
8. **Quality Assurance Layer** - Content validation
9. **Observability Layer** - OpenTelemetry instrumentation for self-monitoring

### Observability Architecture
**OpenTelemetry Integration:**
- **Traces**: Track content generation workflows, AI interactions, web scraping
- **Metrics**: Generation times, success rates, feature classification accuracy
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs, error context
- **Destination**: Send all telemetry to Elastic cluster for self-monitoring

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Track application performance and bottlenecks
- Monitor AI tool usage and costs
- Analyze content generation quality over time
- Alert on failures or performance degradation
