    CRITICAL: FEATURE DEMONSTRATION PHILOSOPHY
    Labs must SHOW features working through observable evidence, not just describe them.
    Bad: "Run a query and see results" (doesn't demonstrate anything)
    Good: "Compare tokens: 147 before ‚Üí 23 after pruning (84% reduction)"

    FEATURE CATEGORIES - Each has specific demonstration requirements:

    1. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (BBQ, Token Pruning, ACORN, Index Sorting)
       MUST show: Baseline metrics ‚Üí Feature config ‚Üí After metrics ‚Üí % improvement ‚Üí Quality proof ‚Üí Cost impact
       Example: "Query time: 8.2s ‚Üí 0.8s (10x faster), Memory: 192GB ‚Üí 9GB (95% reduction)"

    2. DATA INTEGRATION (LOOKUP JOIN, ENRICH, Cross-cluster)
       MUST show: Separated data ‚Üí Manual pain ‚Üí Integration command ‚Üí Combined results ‚Üí Performance proof
       Example: "Before: 5 separate queries. After: 1 query joining all 5 indices in <500ms"

    3. INTELLIGENCE/AI (Semantic Search, Agents, ELSER, ML)
       MUST show: Keyword failures ‚Üí Feature enable ‚Üí Semantic success ‚Üí Recall improvement ‚Üí "How did it know?"
       Example: "Recall: 42% ‚Üí 87% (2x better), finds synonyms keyword search misses"

    4. AUTOMATION (Agents, ILM, Auto-scaling, Watcher)
       MUST show: Manual process (timed) ‚Üí Pain quantified ‚Üí Automation config ‚Üí Automated execution ‚Üí Time saved
       Example: "Manual: 15 min/task √ó 100 tasks/day = 25 hrs/week. Automated: <1s per task"

    5. CONFIGURATION (Security rules, Data tiers, Circuit breakers)
       MUST show: Default behavior ‚Üí Config change ‚Üí New behavior ‚Üí Improvement quantified
       Example: "Before: All data on hot tier ($$$). After: 80% on cold tier (70% cost reduction)"

    6. DETECTION/VISIBILITY (APM, Logs, Metrics, Security Analytics, Threat Detection, Dashboards)
       MUST show: Blind spots ‚Üí Feature enable ‚Üí What's now visible ‚Üí Impact quantified ‚Üí Action enabled
       Example Observability: "Before: 4hr MTTR, manual log correlation. After: 12min MTTR, auto root-cause in service map"
       Example Security: "Before: 0 ransomware detections. After: 3 attacks detected in <2min with 98% confidence, auto-blocked"

    UNIVERSAL LAB STRUCTURE (Instruqt Quality):

    1. EXECUTIVE BUSINESS PROBLEM (3 paragraphs)
       > "CEO/Executive Quote expressing urgent pain with stakes"

       You're a [Specific Role] at [Company Name].

       **The Problem**: [Specific measurable problem]
       - [Quantified pain point 1]
       - [Quantified pain point 2]
       - [Consequence if unsolved]

       **Your Mission**: Use [Feature] to [solve problem] and demonstrate [measurable improvement]

       [By the end, you'll show]:
       - ‚úÖ Before: [Baseline metric]
       - ‚úÖ After: [Improved metric with %]
       - ‚úÖ Business Impact: [$ or efficiency gain]

    2. PROGRESSIVE CHALLENGES (5-7 challenges with "aha moments")
       Challenge 1: BASELINE - Measure current state (show the problem)
       Challenge 2: QUICK WIN - Simplest feature use (immediate small improvement)
       Challenge 3: REAL POWER - Intermediate use (significant improvement)
       Challenge 4: ADVANCED - Complex scenario (dramatic improvement)
       Challenge 5: PRODUCTION READY - Add monitoring/best practices
       Challenge 6: BUSINESS VALIDATION - Prove ROI with exact metrics

       Each challenge MUST include:
       ```markdown
       ## Challenge X: [Title]

       **Business Question**: > "[Executive quote asking for specific result]"

       **What You're Doing**: [1 sentence explanation]
       **Why It Matters**: [Business reason]

       ### Execute This Command:
       ```copy
       [EXACT command, NO placeholders like <index_name>]
       ```

       ### Expected Success Output:
       ```nocopy
       {exact JSON output they should see}
       ```

       ### Verify It Worked:
       ```copy
       [Verification command]
       ```

       ### Expected Verification:
       ```nocopy
       {exact verification output}
       ```

       ### ‚úÖ Success Criteria:
       - [Specific checkable thing 1 with number]
       - [Specific checkable thing 2 with number]

       ### üìä Key Metrics:
       - [Metric name]: [Before value] ‚Üí [After value] ([X% improvement])

       ### ‚ùå If You See Errors:
       **Error**: "[Exact error message]"
       **Fix**: [Exact solution]
       ```

    3. DATASET SETUP (Copy-paste ready)
       - Use realistic company names (TechMart, FinTech Pro, MediaStream, etc.)
       - 50-500 records per table (not thousands - keep it manageable)
       - Show EXACT bulk commands, not "load your data"
       - Include verification: `GET /_cat/indices?v` showing doc counts

    4. BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISONS (Critical for demonstration!)
       Always show side-by-side metrics:
       | Metric | Before Feature | After Feature | Improvement |
       |--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
       | Query time | 8.2s | 0.8s | 10x faster |
       | Memory | 192GB | 9GB | 95% reduction |
       | Storage | 1.2TB | 0.24TB | 80% savings |

    5. BUSINESS IMPACT CALCULATION (Final challenge)
       **Your Production Scenario**:
       - [Scale numbers]
       - Current: [Current state with costs]

       **With [Feature]**:
       - [Metric 1]: [Improvement]
       - [Metric 2]: [Improvement]

       **Cost Savings** (AWS pricing):
       - [Line item 1]: $X/month saved
       - [Line item 2]: $Y/month saved
       - **Total: $Z/month = $Annual/year**

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (Non-negotiable):
    - ALL ES|QL syntax must be valid for Elasticsearch 8.15+
    - ALL commands must be copy-paste executable (no <placeholders>)
    - EVERY command must show expected output in ```nocopy blocks
    - EVERY improvement must be quantified (numbers, not "better")
    - EVERY claim must have observable evidence (show tokens, show metrics)
    - Sample data must be realistic and internally consistent
    - Timestamps should be recent (last 30 days)

       - Each with business question
       - Exact copy-paste commands
       - Expected outputs shown
       - Metrics quantifying improvement
       - Before/After comparisons

    3. Observable Demonstration
       - Show the feature's mechanism visibly
       - Prove it with metrics, not descriptions
       - Side-by-side comparisons
