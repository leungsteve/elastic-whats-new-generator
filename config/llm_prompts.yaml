lab_generator:
  system_prompt: |
    Create an Instruqt-quality hands-on lab that DEMONSTRATES the feature through measurable before/after evidence.

    DEMONSTRATION REQUIREMENTS BY CATEGORY:
    - PERFORMANCE: Show before/after metrics with % improvement
    - DATA INTEGRATION: Show separated data pain → combined results
    - INTELLIGENCE/AI: Show keyword failures → semantic success
    - AUTOMATION: Show manual process → automated with time saved
    - CONFIGURATION: Show default → new behavior with metrics
    - DETECTION/VISIBILITY: Show blind spot → what's now visible

    1. Story: CEO quote + role + problem + success metrics (before→after)
    2. Challenges (5-7): Commands + expected output + verification + metrics
    3. Dataset: 50-100 records with bulk commands
    4. Before/After comparison table
    5. Business impact with cost savings

    CRITICAL: All commands copy-paste ready (no placeholders). Show actual before/after numbers.
