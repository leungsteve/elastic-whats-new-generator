## 2. What We're Currently Working On

### ✅ Recently Completed (Latest: 2025-09-30)
- **Content Integration Enhancement**: Dramatically improved how research flows into presentations
  - **Dynamic Content Depth**: Adjusts use cases (3-5), capabilities (4-6), benefits (3-5) based on audience/technical depth
  - **Quantified Metrics Prominent**: Business case slides now show "5x faster", "32x compression", "9/10 datasets improved"
  - **Technical Deep-Dive Support**: Configuration examples, API commands, and technical requirements for technical audiences
  - **Enriched Context**: Added comparisons, limitations, quantified improvements to feature context
  - **Enhanced Prompts**: "QUANTIFY EVERYTHING" directive, detailed business case requirements, content usage instructions
  - **Validated Results**: Test presentation shows concrete metrics in business ROI slide
- **UI Layout Optimization**: Fixed white space issues in presentations/labs split-view layout
  - Resolved `.tab-content` not filling parent `.content` container (added width/height: 100%)
  - Reduced sidebar width from 260px to 180px for more workspace
  - Reduced main container padding/gap from 1rem to 0.5rem
  - Made `.content` background transparent for cleaner split-view appearance
- **Enhanced Content Extraction**: Added lab and presentation generation hints
  - 8 new fields in LLMExtractedContent (hands-on exercises, sample data, validation checkpoints, demo scenarios, etc.)
  - 16 detailed extraction guidelines (expanded from 8) for better AI content generation
  - Lab hints and presentation hints now integrated into generation context
- **Research Trigger UI**: Added research action buttons with status-based icons
  - Confirmation dialog for LLM cost awareness
  - Fixed API request body format (feature_id, force_refresh)
  - Enhanced feature details display with lab/presentation hint sections
- **Debugging Protocol**: Added comprehensive debugging guidelines to CLAUDE.md
  - Evidence-first approach with DevTools screenshots
  - Anti-patterns to avoid during troubleshooting
  - One targeted fix methodology

### Current Status
- **Application is Production Ready**: End-to-end flow from feature creation to presentation generation works
- **UI Optimized**: Split-view layouts provide maximum workspace with minimal chrome
- **Content Quality**: Enhanced AI extraction provides better hints for lab and presentation generation
- **API Stability**: All 34 endpoints functional with proper error handling

## 3. What's Next

### Immediate Priorities
1. ✅ ~~**Content Integration Enhancement**~~: Completed - quantified metrics now flow prominently into presentations
2. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on presentation quality with new quantified content
3. **Apply to Labs**: Extend content integration improvements to lab generation
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor API response times and optimize heavy operations

### Future Enhancements (Documented in docs/future-enhancements.md)
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for full observability
- Multi-modal content generation (images, charts)
- Content governance and approval workflows
- Advanced competitive analysis features

## 4. Important Technical Decisions & Gotchas

### Architecture Decisions
- **Demo Mode First**: Implemented mock AI responses to enable testing without external API dependencies
- **Domain-Specific Rules**: Web scraping uses domain-specific content selectors for better extraction
- **Pydantic Models**: Comprehensive data validation throughout the application
- **FastAPI + Elasticsearch**: RESTful API design with document-based feature storage

### Critical Gotchas & Lessons Learned

#### UI/CSS Debugging (NEW - 2025-09-30)
```css
/* GOTCHA: Block elements don't automatically fill parent height/width */
.tab-content.active {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;   /* Required! */
    height: 100%;  /* Required! */
}
/* Without these, gray space appears even with padding: 0 */

/* LESSON: Always request DevTools screenshot BEFORE making CSS changes */
/* Don't make 5+ incremental adjustments - diagnose root cause first */
```

#### Web Scraping Configuration
```python
# GOTCHA: Must enable web scraping in .env
ENABLE_WEB_SCRAPING=true  # Not false!

# GOTCHA: Domain rules must handle www. subdomains
domains_to_check = [domain]
if domain.startswith('www.'):
    domains_to_check.append(domain[4:])
```

#### Content Selectors for elastic.co
```python
# WORKING selectors for Elastic documentation
"content_selectors": ["article", "main", ".guide-content", ".guide-section"]
# NOT: [".content", ".main", "#main-content"]  # These don't work
```

#### StoryArcPlanner Method Names
```python
# CORRECT method name
story_arc = story_arc_planner.create_story_arc(features, domain, request)
# NOT: plan_story_arc()  # This method doesn't exist
```

#### Import Conflicts
```python
# GOTCHA: Avoid class name conflicts
from src.core.models import ContentGenerationRequest as StorytellingContentGenerationRequest
```

#### Async/Sync Method Usage
```python
# GOTCHA: ContentGenerator methods are synchronous
presentation = content_generator.generate_complete_presentation(features, request)
# NOT: await content_generator.generate_complete_presentation()
```

### URL Validation
- **Always verify documentation URLs**: Sample data contained outdated 404 links
- **Use official Elastic docs**: `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/`
- **Test scraping before committing**: URLs may change or become unavailable

### Error Handling Patterns
- **500 errors often cascade**: Fix method names first, then parameter signatures, then async usage
- **Validation errors in Pydantic**: Make advanced fields optional during development
- **Domain matching**: Always handle subdomain variations in URL processing

## Current System Health
- ✅ **API Server**: Running on port 8000
- ✅ **Elasticsearch**: Connected and indexed with sample features
- ✅ **Web Scraping**: Functional with 8,666+ words scraped successfully
- ✅ **Content Research**: End-to-end pipeline working
- ✅ **Presentation Generation**: All storytelling endpoints operational
- ✅ **Version Control**: All fixes committed and pushed to GitHub

**Status**: Ready for production use and further feature development.
