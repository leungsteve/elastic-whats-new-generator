# Elastic What's New Generator - Project Status

## 1. What We've Accomplished So Far

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- **FastAPI REST API**: 34 endpoints across all feature domains (Search, Observability, Security)
- **Advanced Storytelling Framework**: Complete implementation with story arcs, talk tracks, and narrative flow
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Unified presentations and domain-specific content generation
- **Demo Mode Configuration**: Full setup with mock AI responses and sample data
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Feature storage and retrieval with 10 sample features available

### Content Research Pipeline ✅
- **Web Scraping Service**: Fully functional content research with domain-specific rules
- **Content Extraction**: Successfully scrapes 8,666+ words from Elastic documentation
- **Content Enhancement**: AI-powered content analysis and key concept extraction
- **Research Persistence**: Automatic storage of scraped content in Elasticsearch

### Recent Critical Fixes ✅
- **Web Scraping Restoration**: Fixed disabled scraping, domain mismatch issues, and content selectors
- **StoryArcPlanner Integration**: Resolved method naming and parameter signature issues
- **ContentGenerator Enhancement**: Fixed async/await errors and import conflicts
- **Sample Data Updates**: Replaced 404 URLs with working documentation links
- **Domain Configuration**: Updated elastic.co rules with working content selectors

### API Endpoints (34 Total)
- **Feature Management**: CRUD operations, search, classification
- **Content Research**: URL scraping, content enhancement, research retrieval
- **Presentation Generation**: Theme-based, domain-specific, and unified presentations
- **Advanced Storytelling**: Customer stories, business value, competitive analysis
- **Lab Generation**: Instruqt labs with hands-on exercises

## 2. What We're Currently Working On

### ✅ Recently Completed
- All critical 500 errors in advanced storytelling endpoints have been resolved
- Web scraping pipeline is fully functional and tested
- Sample data has been updated with working URLs
- All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub

### Current Status
- **Application is Ready for Use**: End-to-end flow from feature creation to presentation generation works
- **Content Quality**: Scraped content is now properly integrated into presentations
- **API Stability**: All 34 endpoints are functional with proper error handling

## 3. What's Next

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Content Integration Enhancement**: Further improve how scraped research content flows into slide generation
2. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on presentation quality and narrative flow
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor API response times and optimize heavy operations

### Future Enhancements (Documented in docs/future-enhancements.md)
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for full observability
- Multi-modal content generation (images, charts)
- Content governance and approval workflows
- Advanced competitive analysis features

## 4. Important Technical Decisions & Gotchas

### Architecture Decisions
- **Demo Mode First**: Implemented mock AI responses to enable testing without external API dependencies
- **Domain-Specific Rules**: Web scraping uses domain-specific content selectors for better extraction
- **Pydantic Models**: Comprehensive data validation throughout the application
- **FastAPI + Elasticsearch**: RESTful API design with document-based feature storage

### Critical Gotchas & Lessons Learned

#### Web Scraping Configuration
```python
# GOTCHA: Must enable web scraping in .env
ENABLE_WEB_SCRAPING=true  # Not false!

# GOTCHA: Domain rules must handle www. subdomains
domains_to_check = [domain]
if domain.startswith('www.'):
    domains_to_check.append(domain[4:])
```

#### Content Selectors for elastic.co
```python
# WORKING selectors for Elastic documentation
"content_selectors": ["article", "main", ".guide-content", ".guide-section"]
# NOT: [".content", ".main", "#main-content"]  # These don't work
```

#### StoryArcPlanner Method Names
```python
# CORRECT method name
story_arc = story_arc_planner.create_story_arc(features, domain, request)
# NOT: plan_story_arc()  # This method doesn't exist
```

#### Import Conflicts
```python
# GOTCHA: Avoid class name conflicts
from src.core.models import ContentGenerationRequest as StorytellingContentGenerationRequest
```

#### Async/Sync Method Usage
```python
# GOTCHA: ContentGenerator methods are synchronous
presentation = content_generator.generate_complete_presentation(features, request)
# NOT: await content_generator.generate_complete_presentation()
```

### URL Validation
- **Always verify documentation URLs**: Sample data contained outdated 404 links
- **Use official Elastic docs**: `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/`
- **Test scraping before committing**: URLs may change or become unavailable

### Error Handling Patterns
- **500 errors often cascade**: Fix method names first, then parameter signatures, then async usage
- **Validation errors in Pydantic**: Make advanced fields optional during development
- **Domain matching**: Always handle subdomain variations in URL processing

## Current System Health
- ✅ **API Server**: Running on port 8000
- ✅ **Elasticsearch**: Connected and indexed with sample features
- ✅ **Web Scraping**: Functional with 8,666+ words scraped successfully
- ✅ **Content Research**: End-to-end pipeline working
- ✅ **Presentation Generation**: All storytelling endpoints operational
- ✅ **Version Control**: All fixes committed and pushed to GitHub

**Status**: Ready for production use and further feature development.
